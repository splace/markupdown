# What HTTP Headers is my browser sending?

Every time your web browser opens a web page, it sends a " **_request_** " for that page. Part of that request includes a series of " **_headers_** ".

Here is the list of all the headers your browser sent when requesting this page.

There were 4 headers sent:

<table> <tbody> <tr> <th> ACCEPT </th> <td> text/plain </td> </tr> <tr> <th> ACCEPT_ENCODING </th> <td> gzip </td> </tr> <tr> <th> HOST </th> <td> www.whatismybrowser.com </td> </tr> <tr> <th> USER_AGENT </th> <td> Go-http-client/1.1 </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> These headers may vary from site to site (in particular the **_HOST_** and **_COOKIE_** headers!) depending on your settings.

If you're curious and want to learn more about HTTP (a protocol which the <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web> relies on) and HTTP Headers, please read the Wikipedia pages on <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol> and <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields> .
